# Order Service Implementation

This document details the implementation of the Order service and its integration with the GraphQL gateway.

## 1. Service Architecture

The order service has been implemented as a gRPC service using Connect-Go and Protocol Buffers. It follows the same architecture as the existing user and product services in the federated GraphQL system.

The service consists of:

- Protocol buffer definition in `proto/order/v1/order.proto`
- Generated Go code in `gen/go/order/v1/`
- Service implementation in `services/order/`
- GraphQL gateway integration

## 2. Features

The Order service provides the following features:

- Retrieve order details by ID
- Order status tracking with defined states (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Customer association
- Order amount tracking
- Timestamp tracking

## 3. Implementation Details

### Protocol Buffer Definition

The service is defined using Protocol Buffers with a `GetOrder` RPC method and appropriate request/response messages.

### Service Implementation

The Order service implementation provides mock data for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, this would be replaced with actual database queries.

### GraphQL Integration

The Order service is integrated with the GraphQL gateway through:

- GraphQL schema type definitions
- Resolver implementation that calls the Order service
- Client configuration in the GraphQL server

## 4. Testing

Test scripts are provided to verify both:

1. Direct access to the Order service via Connect-Go RPC
2. GraphQL gateway integration with the Order service

Run the tests with:

```bash
./scripts/test-order-service.sh
./scripts/test-graphql-order.sh
```

## 5. Next Steps

Potential enhancements for the Order service:

- Add mutation support for creating and updating orders
- Implement database persistence
- Add filtering and pagination for order queries
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement order history tracking
- Connect orders with product catalog information
